#summary How to download and install ClonalOrigin from source

== Step 0. Obtain and install prerequisite software ==

  * Subversion, from http://subversion.tigris.org
  * GNU Scientific Library
  * Optional: Qt4 development libraries, needed for graphical interface

== Step 1. Check out the ClonalOrigin source code ==

{{{
svn checkout http://clonalorigin.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ clonalorigin
}}}

== Step 2. Configure the ClonalOrigin build ==

We'll assume you want to install to your home directory.
{{{
cd clonalorigin/warg
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=$HOME
}}}

== Step 3. Build and install ClonalOrigin  ==

{{{
make
make install

== Using ClonalOrigin  ==

ClonalOrigin has now been installed to the directory $HOME/bin, as a program called 'warg'.  The name is shorthand for 'weak Ancestral Recombination Graph', a diminutive term for the probabilistic graphical model on which ClonalOrigin does inference.  If $HOME/bin is not already part of your PATH environment variable now would be a good time to add it.  Once done, the ClonalOrigin software can be run simply by typing 'warg'.  Note that if the GNU Scientific Library was installed to a non-standard location, it may be able to add the path to the directory containing libgsl to the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH (on Linux) or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (on Mac OS X).
