#summary An overview of the XML elements used in ClonalOrigin output

As ClonalOrigin runs it samples reconstructions of evolutionary history and stores those reconstructions in an XML file. Summaries of the posterior probability distribution can be generated by averaging or marginalizing the samples recorded in the ClonalOrigin XML to particular statistics of interest. The elements of the XML file include the following:

=== comment ===

This contains a free-form comment. ClonalOrigin XML usually contains such a comment near the beginning of the file to record the command-line and random seed that produced the XML. For example:
{{{
<comment>Command line: /home/koadman/bin/warg -a 1,1,0.1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0 -x 1000000 -y 20000000 -z 200000 -D 20044.3481618381 -T s0.00112569937775542 -R s0.000481565093827776 ../onetree.nwk ../sulfo12_v2_nway500.1 /state/partition1/koadman/warg/warg_ns_phase3.1.xml

}}}

=== nameMap ===

This element contains a mapping from block ID to genome sequence name and location. For example:
{{{
<nameMap>0,1:91998-100087+S_islandicus_M_16_27.gbk;1,2:93175-101264+S_islandicus_M_16_4.gbk;2,3:91842-99931+M1602.gbk;3,4:91834-99923+M1612.gbk;4,5:91995-100085+M1613.gbk;5,6:92165-100254+M1622.gbk;6,7:2501050-2509139-M1623.gbk;7,8:91997-100086+M1630.gbk;8,9:93176-101263+M1640.gbk;9,10:91999-100088+M1643.gbk;10,11:92036-100126+M1646.gbk;11,12:91992-100082+M1647.gbk;</nameMap>
}}}

=== Iteration ===

This is a parent tag, the children of which record all components of the evolutionary reconstruction at a particular state of the MCMC chain.

=== Tree ===

This is a newick format tree recording the clonal relationships among the sequences at a particular iteration. Sequences have been given numeric IDs as documented above in the `nameMap` element.

{{{

}}}

=== State reconstruction details ===

The following elements exist in state reconstructions and may be of interest:

  * *number*  This records the MCMC iteration number
  * *ll*      The log-likelihood at this iteration
  * *prior*   Log-likelihood of the model's prior probability
  * *theta*   Theta, the population mutation rate
  * *rho*     Rho, the population recombination rate
  * *delta*   Delta, the average length of DNA segments transferred by recombination events
  * *tmrca*   TMRCA, the time to the most recent common ancestor (in coalescent units)

=== Recombination edges ===

Every state reconstruction includes a set of recombination edges. These are edges connecting two points on the clonal tree that represent recombination among those lineages, along with a range of the genome that was transferred. For example the edge:
{{{
<recedge><start>4775</start><end>8094</end><efrom>15</efrom><eto>19</eto><afrom>0.22048563116103</afrom><ato>0.04713211862216909</ato></recedge>
}}}
Records a recombination event with a left-end position of 4775 and right-end of 8094, going from clonal tree edge 15 to clonal tree edge 19. The age in the tree at the initiation of the recombination was ~0.22 and at the recipient lineage was ~0.047.
